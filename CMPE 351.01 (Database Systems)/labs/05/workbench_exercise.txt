Using MySQL Workbench;
	1) Create a table named “Department” with the fields “idDepartment” (int) as primary key, “DepartmentName” (varchar).
	2) Create another table named “Project” with the fields “idProject” (int) as primary key, “ProjectName” (varchar), 
	“Budget” (int) and “StartDate” (date).
	3) Create one-to-n non-identifying relationship named “Controls” between “Department” and “Project” tables, 
	where one department may control zero or many projects whereas a project must be controlled by only one department. 
	Double click on the relation you created and set the participation constraints by checking/unchecking “Mandatory” 
	checkboxes from “Foreign Key” tab.
	4) Press CTRL+P to export your EER Diagram as pdf.
	5) Press CTRL+Shift+G (or File/Export/Forward Engineer) in order to generate CREATE script. 
	Click “Next”, click “Next” again and click “Copy to Clipboard”. 
	Then paste the copied script into a txt file named “Lab5.txt”

Submit the pdf you exported on question 4 and the script “Lab5.txt” on question 5 to the blackboard.
