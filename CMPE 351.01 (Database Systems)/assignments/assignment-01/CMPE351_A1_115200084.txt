If there is a strong entity, I directly add a table for that. Also, adding primary key.
If there is a weak entity, I just add a table.
If it is a connection between tables, I choose many-to-many relation to create new table, otherwise, there is no need to create it. Just adding foreign keys between their relatinships.
For participation constrains, I look at one or double lines. Then, If it is one, It is partial, otherwise, it is total.

8 and 9 created because there is a many to many relationship between DEPARTMEN and its location. In many to many relation, we need to create and specify another table to connect their primary keys.
